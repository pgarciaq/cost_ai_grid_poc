# Meeting Prep — July 2, 2026

## Work Summary (June 25 – July 1)

### Week 1 (June 25–27): Foundation

Built the **inventory-watcher** — a Go service consuming OSAC events and
producing cost data. End-to-end pipeline working:

- **OSAC integration** (REQ-1) — Watch stream for real-time events,
  reconciler for drift correction, projects/tenants/instance types synced
- **Metering** — 60-second sweep producing `vm_uptime_seconds`,
  `vm_cpu_core_seconds`, `vm_memory_gib_seconds`, `cluster_uptime_seconds`,
  `cluster_worker_node_seconds` for all billable resources
- **MaaS metering** (REQ-2a/REQ-4) — consumption-based token metering via
  ingest endpoint + simulator (1,700 events/s sustained)
- **Rate engine** (REQ-11) — flat + tiered pricing, default rates seeded,
  cost entries with dollar amounts
- **Quota status API** (REQ-9) — `GET /api/v1/quotas/{tenant_id}` with
  threshold checks at 50/70/90/100%
- **Threshold alerts** (REQ-10, pull model) — fired alerts included in
  quota API response
- **OpenMeter-compatible ingest** — `POST /api/v1/events` accepts the exact
  CloudEvents format the OSAC metering collector produces. Switching the
  collector from OpenMeter to us is a URL change.
- **Koku schema alignment** — rates table extended with `cost_type`
  (Infrastructure/Supplementary) and `koku_metric` for future rate sync

### Weekend (June 28–29): Hardening + Bare Metal

- **Adversarial code review** — 17 findings across 8 dimensions, 9 fixed:
  JWT auth, error handling, input validation, HTTP limits, pagination,
  scanner buffer, N+1 query, JSON injection, division by zero
- **JWT authentication** (#1) — OSAC-compatible, same `golang-jwt` library,
  same token works for both OSAC and our endpoints
- **OSAC List pagination** (#3) — offset/limit loop, prevents phantom
  deletes at scale
- **Bare metal costing** (REQ-8) — full implementation via reconciler
  polling + metering sweep

### Monday–Tuesday (June 30 – July 1): Reports + IPP

- **Report API** (REQ-3/REQ-5) — `GET /api/v1/reports/costs` and
  `/reports/summary`
- **IPP-compatible MaaS format** — 5 token dimensions matching the
  Inference Performance Protocol
- **Balance check endpoint** — IPP-compatible quota check
- **Dashboard demo** — interactive HTML dashboard for cost visualization
- **OpenShift/CRC deployment** — containerized and deployed on CRC:
  - Multi-stage UBI10 container image (164MB), published to quay.io
  - Kubernetes manifests (namespace, PostgreSQL StatefulSet, consumer Deployment)
  - Health probes (`/healthz`, `/readyz`) working
  - PostgreSQL connected, tables auto-created, HTTP API listening
  - OSAC integration pending (fulfillment-service not yet deployed in CRC)
- **Observability plan** — structured logging, metrics, health checks

### Demo (July 1)

Live demo to Cody showing the full pipeline:
- OSAC Watch stream → inventory sync in real-time
- VM creation → appears in cost DB within 1-2 seconds
- 60-second metering sweep → usage records
- 30-second rating sweep → dollar costs
- Quota API with threshold alerts
- MaaS simulator firing 500 events at 200/s
- OpenMeter-compatible CloudEvent ingestion
- Service running on CRC/OpenShift with health probes passing

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No Kafka** — gRPC Watch stream + reconciler (Kubernetes pattern).
   See [ADR-002](decisions/002-arguments-against-kafka.md).

2. **Local metering sweep** — replicates what OSAC heartbeat collector
   would provide. Both produce identical `metering_entries`. The ingest
   endpoint is ready for real collector events.
   See [ADR-003](decisions/003-heartbeat-emitter-vs-sweep.md).

3. **OpenMeter compatibility** — our ingest endpoint accepts the same
   CloudEvents format. Switching the OSAC collector to us = URL change.

4. **Koku naming alignment** — `cost_type`, `koku_metric` on rates.
   Preparing for eventual merge with Koku.

## Open Questions for OSAC

See [meeting-questions-osac.md](meeting-questions-osac.md) for the full
list (18 questions across bare metal, catalog, private API, MaaS,
notifications, transport, tenancy).

**Top priority for this meeting:**

1. **Get access to Noy's dogfood environment** — Noy offered (Jul 1) but
   nobody followed up. We need access to test our ingest endpoint against
   real RHOAI → IPP metering events. Our `POST /api/v1/events` and
   `POST /api/v1/check` already implement the `reportUsage` and
   `checkBalance` APIs — we can replace Noy's metering-simulator as the
   backend. **Action: ask Noy to provide credentials/access today.**

2. **Can we use the private Watch stream?** — unlocks real-time bare metal
   events and catalog item sync

3. **MaaS metrics ownership** — does OSAC collect from RHOAI or do we?
   (Partly answered by Noy's IPP architecture — the IPP plugin calls us
   directly, so RHOAI/gateway is the collector)

4. **Alert transport** — webhook endpoint on OSAC side for push
   notifications?

## Next Steps

### In Progress

1. **OpenShift/CRC setup** — consumer is deployed and running on CRC.
   Next: deploy OSAC fulfillment-service alongside for full integration
   testing. Requires cert-manager, Keycloak, PostgreSQL for OSAC.

2. **Observability** — structured logging in place, health probes working.
   Next: Prometheus metrics endpoint, ServiceMonitor manifest, structured
   metric exposition for metering/rating sweep latencies and event
   throughput.

### Upcoming

3. **Replace Noy Itzikowitz's simulators with our stack** — Noy has two
   simulators: `llm-katan` (echoes inference requests with token data) and
   `metering-simulator` (implements `checkBalance` + `reportUsage` APIs).
   Our ingest endpoint already implements `POST /api/v1/events`
   (`reportUsage`) and the balance check endpoint (`checkBalance`). We can
   replace Noy's metering-simulator — the IPP plugin just needs to point
   at our endpoint. Moti flagged this as a PoC action item for us.

4. **Test against Noy's dogfood environment** — Noy offered access to a
   live environment with real Claude Code and Codex sessions flowing
   through the RHOAI gateway + IPP metering pipeline. We should get access
   and test our ingest endpoint receiving real MaaS events from the IPP
   external-metering plugin. This would validate the full flow:
   RHOAI → IPP plugin → `POST /api/v1/events` → our metering → cost.

5. **Connect to real OSAC collector** — redirect metering collector from
   OpenMeter to our ingest endpoint

6. **Koku rate sync** — read rates from Koku's `cost_model` table

7. **Report API export** — CSV/JSON export for REQ-5

8. **Helm chart** — extract from working K8s manifests

9. **Custom rate dimensions** (REQ-13) — if time permits before July 31
