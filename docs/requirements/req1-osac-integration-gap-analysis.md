# Requirement 1: OSAC Integration — Gap Analysis

> **Requirement:** Synchronize inventory (clusters, VMs, models) from OSAC into
> Cost Management. Consume resource metrics via CloudEvents. Billing is
> capacity-based — charge for what is provisioned, not what is used.
>
> **Source:** [poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1](https://github.com/myersCody/cost_ai_grid_poc/blob/main/docs/requirements/poc_requirements_overview.md#req-1-osac-integration-via-region-management-cluster)

## Current State: inventory-watcher

The `inventory-watcher` is a Go service that connects to the OSAC
fulfillment-service and maintains a cost inventory database. It has three
concurrent components:

- **Watcher** — connects to the OSAC REST gateway's event stream
  (`/api/private/v1/events/watch`) and processes CREATED/UPDATED/DELETED events
  in real time
- **Reconciler** — periodically calls OSAC List endpoints to catch any events
  missed during downtime (drift correction)
- **Summarizer** — calculates daily usage summaries (CPU-core-hours,
  memory-GB-hours) from inventory durations

Verified working end-to-end: reconciliation imports existing OSAC resources,
Watch stream captures real-time creates, inventory correctly tracks cores,
memory, tenant, labels, and lifecycle timestamps.

## Gap Details

### 1. Raw Event Log

**What's missing:** Every incoming event should be stored immutably in a
`raw_events` table before any processing. This provides an audit trail,
enables replay, and supports deduplication. Currently events go straight to
inventory upserts with no record of the original event.

**What's needed:**

- A `raw_events` table with columns: `id`, `ce_id` (unique for dedup),
  `ce_type`, `ce_source`, `ce_time`, `ce_data` (JSONB), `resource_type`,
  `resource_id`, `tenant_id`, `received_at`
- Insert into `raw_events` as the first step before inventory processing
- Deduplicate on `ce_id` (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)

**Effort:** Small — one new table, one insert call at the top of the event
handler.

### 2. Metering Entries

**What's missing:** After storing the raw event, the system should extract
meter values and insert them into a `metering_entries` table. Currently the
summarizer calculates daily aggregates from inventory timestamps, but doesn't
produce per-event metering records.

The defined meters are:

**CaaS (clusters):**
| Meter | Aggregation |
|---|---|
| `cluster_uptime_seconds` | SUM(duration_seconds) where host_type = _control_plane |
| `cluster_worker_node_seconds` | SUM(worker_node_seconds) |
| `cluster_worker_node_count` | MAX(node_count) per cluster per host_type |

**VMaaS (compute instances):**
| Meter | Aggregation |
|---|---|
| `vm_uptime_seconds` | SUM(duration_seconds) |
| `vm_cpu_core_seconds` | SUM(cpu_core_seconds) |
| `vm_memory_gib_seconds` | SUM(memory_gib_seconds) |

**What's needed:**

- A `metering_entries` table with columns: `id`, `raw_event_id` (FK),
  `resource_type`, `resource_id`, `tenant_id`, `meter_name`, `value`, `unit`,
  `period_start`, `period_end`
- A metering handler that extracts meter values from each event and inserts
  one row per meter
- If consuming the Watch stream (which doesn't carry `duration_seconds`),
  calculate duration from the time since the last event for the same resource

**Effort:** Medium — new table, new handler, meter extraction logic.

**Note on event source:** The requirements spec defines CloudEvents from a
metering collector with pre-calculated fields (`duration_seconds`,
`cpu_core_seconds`). This collector is still early-stage. Our Watch stream
consumer gets the same underlying data but must calculate durations itself.
The metering entries are functionally equivalent either way — the difference
is where the duration calculation happens (collector vs consumer).

### 3. Billable State Filtering

**What's missing:** Metering entries should only be produced when the resource
is in a billable state. Currently all state transitions are stored in
inventory but there's no distinction between billable and non-billable.

**Billable states:**
- Clusters: `CLUSTER_STATE_READY`, `CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING`
- Compute instances: `COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_RUNNING`

**Non-billable states (update inventory but don't meter):**
- Clusters: `CLUSTER_STATE_FAILED`, `CLUSTER_STATE_UNSPECIFIED`
- Compute instances: `COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_STOPPED`,
  `COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_PAUSED`, `COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_FAILED`,
  `COMPUTE_INSTANCE_STATE_DELETING`

**What's needed:**

- A billable state check in the metering handler: only insert metering
  entries when `state` is in the billable set
- Inventory updates should still happen for all states (to track transitions)

**Effort:** Small — a state check before metering entry insertion.

### 4. CloudEvents Envelope

**What's missing:** The system currently consumes OSAC's internal protobuf
Watch events (with `id`, `type` as CREATED/UPDATED/DELETED, and resource
payload). The requirements define CloudEvents 1.0 format with `specversion`,
`type`, `source`, `id`, `time`, `subject`, `data` fields.

**Why it matters (and why it doesn't much):**

CloudEvents is an interoperability standard — a standardized envelope around
the same data. For the PoC, the Watch stream works and provides the same
information. The CloudEvents envelope would become important if Kafka is
introduced as transport, but we argue against Kafka for this use case — see
[ADR-002: Arguments Against Kafka](../decisions/002-arguments-against-kafka.md).
The gRPC Watch stream + List reconciliation pattern (the proven Kubernetes
controller pattern) provides the same delivery guarantees with no additional
infrastructure.

**What's needed:**

- A CloudEvents deserialization layer that can parse the standard envelope
  and extract `ce_id`, `ce_type`, `ce_source`, `ce_time`, `ce_subject`,
  and `data`
- Ability to handle both formats: Watch stream events (current) and
  CloudEvents (future) through a common interface

**Effort:** Small — a parser struct and a normalization step. No architectural
change.

### 5. Project Entity

**What's missing:** OSAC uses a Tenant → Project → Resource hierarchy. The
inventory-watcher stores `tenant` as a flat string field on resources but
does not track projects as separate entities.

**What's needed:**

- A `projects` table with `id`, `tenant_id` (FK), `external_id`, `name`
- FK columns on `inventory_compute_instance` and `inventory_cluster`
  pointing to `projects`
- Sync projects from OSAC via the Projects List endpoint (the OSAC client
  already supports this)
- Reconciler should sync projects alongside clusters and compute instances

**Effort:** Small — one new table, a few FK columns, one additional
reconciliation call.

## Processing Pipeline: Current vs Target

**Current (inventory-watcher):**

```
OSAC Watch stream event
  → dispatch by type (CREATED/UPDATED/DELETED)
  → upsert inventory (clusters, compute_instances, instance_types)

Periodic summarizer
  → query inventory for resources alive during period
  → calculate duration × cores = cpu_core_hours
  → write daily_usage_summary
```

**Target (with gaps closed):**

```
Event received (Watch stream or CloudEvents)
  → normalize to common event struct
  → INSERT into raw_events (dedup on ce_id)
  → upsert inventory (clusters, compute_instances, instance_types)
  → if billable state:
      → extract meters (vm_uptime_seconds, cpu_core_seconds, ...)
      → INSERT into metering_entries (one row per meter)

Metering entries feed downstream:
  → rate lookup → cost_entries (requirement #6)
  → quota check → alerts (requirement #5)
  → report API aggregation
```

The key difference: the current system calculates usage in a batch
summarization step from inventory timestamps. The target system produces
metering entries per event as they arrive, which enables real-time quota
checking and the 60-second processing SLA.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed

1. **Raw event log** — `raw_events` table stores every Watch stream event
   immutably, deduplicated on `event_id`. Events are stored before inventory
   processing so nothing is lost even if the upsert fails.

2. **Metering entries** — periodic 60-second sweep produces per-resource
   metering entries for all billable compute instances. Three meters:
   `vm_uptime_seconds`, `vm_cpu_core_seconds`, `vm_memory_gib_seconds`.
   Duration is tracked via `last_metered_at` on inventory records. On DELETE
   events, final metering entries capture usage up to the deletion timestamp.
   See [ADR-001](../decisions/001-metering-sweep-interval.md) for the 60-second
   interval decision.

3. **Billable state filtering** — only RUNNING compute instances produce
   metering entries. Non-billable states (STOPPED, FAILED, PAUSED, DELETING)
   update inventory but generate no metering. Billable states defined in
   `metering/billable.go` for both VMs and clusters.

4. **Project entity** — `inventory_project` table with tenant field.
   Watcher handles Project CREATED/UPDATED events from the Watch stream.
   Reconciler syncs projects from OSAC on startup. Establishes the
   Tenant → Project → Resource hierarchy from the requirements.

5. **Cluster metering** — `cluster_uptime_seconds` and
   `cluster_worker_node_seconds` meters. Worker node seconds are
   calculated as SUM(node_set_size × duration) across all node sets
   parsed from the cluster's `node_sets` JSONB. Billable states:
   CLUSTER_STATE_READY, CLUSTER_STATE_PROGRESSING.

### Remaining Gaps

| Gap | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **CloudEvents envelope** | Small | Parse standard CE wrapper; deferred — Watch stream works for PoC |

### What's Next (beyond req #1)

The metering pipeline is now the foundation for downstream requirements:

- **Rates + cost entries** (req #6) — look up rate by `meter_name` +
  `resource_type`, compute `cost = metering_value × rate`, insert into
  `cost_entries`. Tiered pricing applies here.
- **Quota tracking** (req #4) — aggregate `metering_entries` by tenant +
  meter_name for a period, compare against `quotas.limit_value`.
- **Alerts** (req #5) — when accumulated metering crosses a threshold
  percentage of quota, insert alert and notify OSAC.
- **MaaS** (req #2) — add `osac.model.lifecycle` event handling with
  token-based meters (`maas_tokens_in`, `maas_requests`). Same pipeline,
  different meters.

## Test Coverage

19 assertions across 5 test groups (see `snippets/test-inventory-watcher.sh`):

1. **Reconciliation** — tables created, all OSAC resources imported, specs correct
2. **Watch stream + raw events** — real-time event capture, raw event stored with metadata
3. **Metering sweep** — entries created for 3 meter types, all billable instances metered, positive values
4. **Deduplication** — duplicate event_id rejected
5. **Data integrity** — all events have payload, no empty tenants
