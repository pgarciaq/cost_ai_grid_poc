# Open Questions for OSAC Team

> Consolidated from gap analyses and implementation work.
> Last updated: 2026-07-14

## Bare Metal (REQ-8)

1. **Hardware specs for BareMetalInstance** — The BareMetalInstance proto
   has no `cores`/`memory_gib` in its spec. It only references a
   `catalog_item`. To meter CPU/memory usage (like we do for VMs), we need
   to resolve the hardware profile from the catalog item → template chain.
   **Question:** Is this the intended lookup path? Or will hardware specs
   be added directly to BareMetalInstance in the future?

2. **Standalone bare metal** — Do we need to support bare metal nodes
   outside of an OpenShift cluster? The proto supports it but the
   requirement is unclear.
   Answer: YES. RHEL bare metal, Windows bare metal, etc are a reality.

3. **BareMetalInstance in public Watch stream** — Currently only in the
   private event stream (field 27). Any plans to add it to the public
   oneOf? We can work around it via REST List polling, but real-time events
   would be better.
   > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Martin confirmed with Aishay that
   > bare metal events are indeed missing from the public gRPC API
   > (private-only). Path forward: Martin will either file a PR upstream
   > himself or work with Aishay to find the right owner to add it to the
   > public stream. No committed timeline yet.

## Catalog Items

4. **Catalog item change frequency** — How often do catalog items change
   in practice? We plan to poll them via REST List periodically. Is
   5-minute polling sufficient, or should we request they be added to the
   public Watch stream?
   > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Martin noted catalog items are
   > also missing from the public gRPC stream (private-only, same as bare
   > metal — see item 3 and item 6). However, unlike bare metal, catalog
   > items don't need real-time delivery for the PoC — periodic REST List
   > polling is confirmed sufficient. Getting catalog items onto the
   > public stream is a nice-to-have, not a blocker.

5. **Catalog → pricing mapping** — The catalog item defines the SKU
   (template + field constraints). Should pricing/rates be associated with
   catalog items (SKU-based pricing) or with the underlying templates?
   This affects how we structure rate lookups.

## Private vs Public API

6. **Can the cost consumer use the private Watch stream?** — The private
   event stream has 28 entity types vs 10 on the public stream, including
   all catalog items, BareMetalInstance, networking entities, and a new
   `EVENT_TYPE_OBJECT_SIGNALED` event type. Since our consumer runs in the
   management cluster, is it authorized to use the private API?
   > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Per Martin's conversation with
   > Aishay, the recommendation is to use the **public** gRPC API, not the
   > private one — the public API is simply missing some entities today
   > (bare metal, catalog items). Martin will pursue getting those added
   > to the public stream (item 3, item 4) rather than relying on private
   > API access.

## MaaS (REQ-2a / REQ-4)

7. **Who collects MaaS metrics — Cost or OSAC?** — RHOAI serves model
   inference. If OSAC collects from RHOAI and forwards via events, we're a
   pure consumer. If Cost must collect directly from RHOAI, we need a
   separate integration. Which is the plan?
   > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Moti is designing an OSAC-side
   > metering service that would collect all events for the system and
   > expose a single entry point, with adapters to each downstream system
   > (Cost Management, M360, OpenMeter, etc.) — meaning Cost would not
   > need to interact with MaaS directly. This is still a draft design,
   > not yet reviewed, and Moti is **not confident it lands by end of
   > July**. Decision for the PoC: keep building the current real-time
   > direct-integration path (Martin/Noy touch points) in parallel; if
   > OSAC's collector is ready in time, integrate with it, otherwise
   > ship with the direct path and revisit Aug 1. Not fully resolved —
   > still need OSAC to confirm final direction.

8. **MaaS CloudEvents schema** — Our proposed schema (tokens_in,
   tokens_out, request_count, model_name, duration_seconds) is
   unconfirmed. Key unknowns:
   - Are token counts per-interval increments or cumulative?
   - Is `model_name` a stable identifier for rate lookups?
   - What states does a model deployment have?

9. **Will Model be an OSAC entity?** — It is unclear whether OSAC will
   add a formal Model entity to the fulfillment-service (proto + API +
   Watch stream, like ComputeInstance) or whether models will remain
   identified only by name in the CloudEvent `data.model` field. Our
   implementation works either way, but the answer affects inventory
   tracking and reconciliation. If Model becomes an entity, we add it
   to the watcher/reconciler. If not, CloudEvents ingest is the only
   data source for MaaS.

10. **Token granularity** — The IPP external-metering plugin sends 4 token
    dimensions: prompt, completion, cached, reasoning. We currently meter
    `tokens_in` and `tokens_out`. Should we match the 4-dimension model,
    or map prompt→in, completion→out and add cached+reasoning as separate
    meters? Pricing may differ per dimension (e.g., cached tokens cheaper).
    > **Update (Jul 18, 2026):** Decision made — only `maas_tokens_in`, `maas_tokens_out`, and `maas_requests` are metered. `cached_input_tokens` and `reasoning_tokens` are subsets of input/output tokens (per OpenAI API spec); billing them separately would double-count. They are parsed from CloudEvents for observability but do not produce metering entries.

## Threshold Notifications (REQ-10)

11. **Quota alert mechanism shelved** — Per "Cost Management + OSAC"
    meeting, 2026-07-02: "quota alert mechanism — deferred until after
    the PoC." Pull-based threshold checks (quota API + IPP balance check)
    are the agreed approach for now. Push webhooks not needed for PoC.
    Revisit post-PoC if OSAC builds an alert ingestion endpoint.
    > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Ronnie drew a distinction that
    > refines this: **budget quotas** (monetary) could plausibly be
    > handled with the event/notification model, since checking budget
    > before starting a resource and alerting at 80%/90% doesn't need
    > sub-second consistency. **Usage quotas** (VM count, storage, etc.)
    > are different — OSAC needs a synchronous answer *during* the
    > provisioning flow (e.g. "can I start this VM right now"), so an
    > event-based/eventually-consistent model risks OSAC duplicating
    > state it would otherwise get from Cost. Conclusion: both a
    > pre-check API (REQ-9, have it) and a push alert mechanism are
    > needed, they're just not interchangeable. Separately, Moti
    > reiterated OSAC has **no receiver** to act on any notification
    > event today — even if Cost emits it, nothing on OSAC's side
    > consumes or acts on it (audit-only value at best). Martin noted
    > this is cheap for Cost to add on short notice ("by the end of the
    > week or sooner") **if** OSAC hands over a concrete CloudEvent spec
    > for what they want to receive — the ball is in OSAC's court to
    > define the receiver and the schema.

11. ~~**Alert transport**~~ — Deferred per above. If revisited post-PoC:
    webhook with shared secret, CloudEvent POST, or mTLS.

12. **Grace periods** — Does hitting 100% quota mean immediate cutoff or
    is there a grace window? This affects whether we send a single alert
    or a sequence (100% → grace started → grace expired).

## Event Transport

13. **Kafka for CloudEvents** — Is there a plan to deliver OSAC events
    via Kafka? Adding a Kafka consumer on our side is low effort (~150
    lines, same `handleEvent` pipeline). If OSAC plans Kafka delivery,
    we should align on topic naming, serialization format (JSON
    CloudEvents vs protobuf), and consumer group semantics.

14. **MaaS event delivery guarantees** — The IPP's `reportUsage` call
    (`POST /api/v1/events`) is currently fire-and-forget HTTP. For
    production, events cannot be lost. Options: Kafka, persistent local
    buffer with replay, or CloudEvents webhook with retry + DLQ. What
    infrastructure does OSAC already run? We'd rather build on that than
    introduce new components.

## Cluster Lifecycle (REQ-1a)

15. ~~**"Cluster orders" vs Cluster entity**~~ — **Resolved.** ClusterOrder
    is the ordering/provisioning workflow: a user POSTs a ClusterOrder, the
    operator provisions the actual Cluster, and the order transitions
    through states (`CLUSTER_ORDER_STATE_ACCEPTED` → `_FULFILLED` /
    `_FAILED`). The resulting Cluster is a separate entity in the Watch
    stream. For cost purposes we track the **Cluster** (the running
    resource that incurs cost), not the ClusterOrder (the purchase request).
    No action needed — we already consume Cluster events.

    update-order-status flow.*

## Tenant/Project Attribution (REQ-3a)

16. **Cost UI ownership** — Will providers view cost data in the Cost
    Management UI or in OSAC's own UI? This affects where we build
    reporting and who needs access.
    > **Update (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Discussion expanded this beyond
    > "where is cost shown." OSAC has multiple UI surfaces (provider
    > portal, tenant portal, user portal), and the experience will differ
    > depending on which billing backend a customer uses (M360 vs
    > OpenMeter vs Cost Management vs a third party) — Pau's view is that
    > using Cost Management's own tooling should feel as integrated as
    > using native OSAC/ACM/OpenShift tooling, similar to how not using
    > native permissions in OpenShift/ACM is expected to feel less
    > integrated. Moti and Pau converged on needing an **abstraction
    > layer** — not just for metering, but for catalog and UI too — e.g.
    > OSAC exposes generic placeholder screens/APIs that any billing
    > backend (Cost Management, M360, OpenMeter, third party) can push
    > data into, so the experience is consistent regardless of which
    > backend is source of truth. Still unresolved whether this is
    > feasible for Jul 31 or Aug 31; if not, action item is to track it
    > as future work.

17. ~~**Quota scope**~~ — **Resolved (updated Jul 20, 2026).** Quotas/budgets
    scoped per tenant AND per project. Projects roll up to tenant (sum of
    project consumptions cannot exceed tenant quota). **Sum of project-level
    limits must not exceed the tenant-level limit** (no overcommit of limits).
    Currently we only have tenant-level quotas; project-level quotas with
    rollup is new work. See [req9-quota-budget-gap-analysis.md](req9-quota-budget-gap-analysis.md).
    *Source: PR #33 (Pau Garcia Quiles), REQ-3a/REQ-9; overcommit rule clarified Jul 20.*

18. **RBAC model** — Pau clarified (PR #33): "Using Insights RBAC is
    NOT mandatory. We may want to move to a simpler model, e.g. per
    tenant and project, like OSAC does, where authentication is what
    matters and authorization hardly exists." Fine-grained RBAC deferred
    post-PoC provided Cost implements project-within-tenant concept.
    Still open: final decision on Insights RBAC vs Keycloak-native.

## MaaS Tenant Attribution (IPP Integration)

19. **How to derive tenant from IPP CloudEvent?** — The IPP CloudEvent
    ([plugin.go](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-gateway-payload-processing/blob/61b6160/pkg/plugins/external-metering/plugin.go))
    carries `user`, `group`, `subscription` but no `tenant_id`. The
    MaaSSubscription CR is namespaced
    ([e2e report](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-gateway-payload-processing/blob/main/test/e2e/reports/3.4/external-model-e2e-report.md))
    but may live in a shared MaaS namespace, not per-tenant. Which of
    these fields maps to the OSAC tenant? Or do we need an explicit
    `tenant_id` added to the event?
    See [research](../research/maas-tenant-attribution.md).

20. **Add X-MaaS-Tenant upstream?** — Would it be feasible to add a
    `X-MaaS-Tenant` header in the Authorino AuthPolicy (from the
    subscription namespace) and a `tenant_id` field in the CloudEvent
    data payload? This would give us clean attribution without
    convention-based parsing.

## Data Privacy / PII (MaaS)

21. **User-level attribution and PII** — Raised by Avishay/Yon's design
    review: if OSAC/RHOAI forwards per-user identifiers (`user_id`,
    `subscription_id`) in MaaS CloudEvents, Cost Management could
    identify which individual user consumed how much (e.g. "$1,000 by
    user X"). Is this considered sensitive personal information?
    **Discussion (Jul 14, 2026 meeting):** Action Item: Pau to investigate.
    **Not resolved** — no answer yet on whether per-user cost attribution
    (REQ-3) needs to be restricted, anonymized, or aggregated to avoid
    exposing individual user consumption.

## Catalog Pricing Model

22. **Catalog price override by tenant** — Can a tenant (or tenant admin)
    override the prices of catalog items set by the CSP/provider? Or can
    a tenant admin create their own offering to their own tenant's users
    (e.g. a curated image bundled with software, priced with a markup)?
    Raised by Moti as an open question with no answer yet — it's unclear
    whether OSAC plans to support either capability. Two distinct
    behaviors are bundled in this question: (a) different catalog prices
    per tenant, and (b) a tenant admin creating and pricing their own
    sub-offerings for their users. Neither has been discussed
    conclusively; Rafi's training material covers user experience but not
    the administration/pricing model. Relates to item 5 (catalog →
    pricing mapping).

23. **ComputeInstance dropping CPU/memory fields** — Moti flagged an
    upcoming OSAC change where CPU and memory are being removed from
    `ComputeInstance`, and the measured/billable unit becomes
    `instance_type` only. If Cost Management's cost model doesn't rely on
    raw CPU/memory (which it shouldn't, per REQ-3b's catalog-item-based
    pricing design), this should be a non-issue — but it needs explicit
    verification. Action item: Martin to confirm cost calculation works
    purely from instance type and doesn't break when CPU/memory fields
    disappear. Martin asked Moti for a pointer to the relevant PR/
    discussion to track this.
    > **Update (Jul 18, 2026):** Catalog fallback implemented in the metering sweep (PR #59) — when `cores == 0`, specs resolved from InstanceType catalog. Per-SKU pricing via `instance_type` rate dimension also implemented. See [req3b gap analysis](req3b-instance-type-only-gap-analysis.md).
